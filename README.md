# Solid for X developer

Solid is a purely reactive library. It was designed from the ground up with a reactive core. It's influenced by reactive principles developed by previous libraries. Solid follows the same philosophy as React with unidirectional data flow, read/write segregation, and immutable interfaces. It just has a completely different implementation that forgoes using a Virtual DOM.

This is just a brief introduction if you are from other Javascript framework. If you want to learn Solid from scratch, I recommend by doing the [Tutorial](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/) from the official Solid website.
